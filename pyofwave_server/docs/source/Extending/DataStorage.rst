Data Storage Extensions
***********************

.. note:: Not yet fully implemented.

If the existing data storage options don't suit you, you can easily add your own.

1. Preparing the Datasource
===========================

The datasource needs to be set up to be able to store PyOfWave documents before you integrate it. To do this, setup your datasource to store XML and access elements by their ID (which would be in the form of a Wave URL).

2. Implement the Adaptor
========================

Add a new Python file in datasource (doesn't really matter if you put it there) and code::

   from pyofwave.core import datasource
   from zope.interface import implements

   class MyDataStorage(object):
      implements(datasource.Datasource)

      def newDocument(self, doc):
         """Create a new Document in datastorage."""

      def getDocument(self, doc):
         """Retrieve document named doc (which includes the domain) and 
            return as a Document object."""

      def getDocumentVersion(self, doc, start, end, limit):
         """Retrieve specified deltas for the document and 
            return as Delta objects."""

      def searchDocuments(self, user, search):
         """Retrieve a list of document names which match the tags 
            provided by setTags."""

      def applyDelta(self, doc, delta):
         """Save the delta to the user. Use applyDelta(doc, delta) 
            if you need to store the complete current document. """

Implement the methods. 

Make sure you allow your users to override the default config by using
variables coming from their :file:`settings.py`. Here's an example::

      from pyofwave.conf import settings

      class MyDataSource(object):
         def __init__(self, path=None, checkDomain=None):
            self.path = path or settings.MYDATASOURCE_PATH
            self.checkDomain = checkDomain or settings.MYDATASOURCE_CHECKDOMAIN


3. Integrate the Adaptor
========================

In your :file:`settings.py` set :py:data:`DATASOURCE_STORAGE` to the
path of your adaptor. For example, to use the file storage backend::

     DATASOURCE_STORAGE = 'storage.files.FileStorage'

Then, declare the variables required by the backend such as::

     FILESTORAGE_PATH = 'waves/'

Also ensure that the applyDelta method is set to observe betaDeltaObservable, ``betaDeltaObservable.addObserver(STORAGE_OBJECT.applyDelta)``.

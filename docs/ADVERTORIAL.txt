What is Wave?

In today's world, we use multiple communications technologies to collaborate accross distances: eMail, instant messaging, wikis, and forums. What if all of those were one technology? That one technology is Wave, the new flexible live communications technology. Furthermore, Wave allows you to combine charactoristics of these technologies as pleases you for even more powerful communications. 
Wave itself is a decentralized set of internet protocals which multiple groups work with and partially implement. This is the same as the web and eMail with multiple servers (ran by providers), and clients (e.g. browsers). It takes live messaging from IM (as well as it's protocal), and message organisation and structure from eMail. It is fully editable like a wiki, and it is formatted like a forum. In this way it is a combination of all communications services. 

When Wave was first suggested by Google in 2008, it was a solution without a problem, leading it to fail (Plus it was a majour company pushing a new standard, not a grass roots movement that caused the success of former ones, like eMail and the Web). This time though, I will make it a solution to a problem, and I encourage others to do the same. I am confident that pitching from below rather than above is the approach neccessary, as it would lead to more natural adoptation. 
If you are a developer wanting to contribute to Wave, I have a few things to say for the health of Wave. I discourage adding waves and robots for the fun of it, but rather add ones you find yourself wanting. Instead, I want you to create client APIs for your language of choice, create a client for the OS/platform of your choice, or creating a new server. These are things needed by users and covers lots of ground, and deserves focus. Of course, I would also encourage eMail providers and the like to also adopt Wave, or new providers to pop up around Wave.

Please note, these standards may include a few very slight changes which I feel improves the system. I do not have incompatibility fears due to the fact that Google is no longer taking this on.

To help you find the correct standard, the next lines copy out the Jobs for each standard:
-Wave Event Protocal: Facilitates communicating live changes to the client.
-Federation Format: This standard defines a document structure that can be passed around in the federation standard. 
-Federation Protocal: To sync documents containing waves between servers. 
-Gadget API: A minimal API for gadget developers to use and wave clients to implement.
-Simple Data Protocal: Allows browser clients to communicate actions to the server.
-Wave Client Protocal: Provides a lower bandwidth and lighter weight alternative to the Simple Data Protocal
-Wave Format: To describe the concepts and standards used between the other wave standards.
-Wave URL: To define a method for linking to waves.

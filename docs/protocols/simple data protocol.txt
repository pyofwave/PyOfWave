Simple Data Protocal
--------------------

Job: Allows browser clients to communicate actions to the server.
Existing Standards: JSON, HTTP, wave format, Oauth

Overview:
---
This standard allows clients to send minipulations to the server. Each minipulation has a name, id, and parameters. This is represented as a JSON formatted POST to a URL.

Format:
---
The root object is an array containing objects of the form:
{
   params : object (properties donoted by method),
   id : String (donotes order of executing),
   method : String (method to execute)
}

Security
---
Handled by the Oauth, or another, standard. This protocol cannot be used without authentication, apart from the auth.authMethod method. Other methods may also be provided.

Methods:
---
 Method					Description
 ------					-----------
 auth.authMethod			Returns how containing an array containing a 
					selection of ("Oauth", "SSL") appropriately for 
					the methods of authentication the server 
					supports. (Note: The list may be expanded.)
 auth.logout				Cancels authentication.	

 robot.notifyCapabilitiesHash		Sends an XML file to the server registering 
   (cababilitiesHash : String)		the client for events identified.
 robot.createWavelet			Creates a new wavelet from waveletData and 
   (waveletData : WaveletData,		identifies with message. (NOTE: TBD_ prefix may 
      message : String)			be used for temporary ID's)
 robot.fetchFolders			Responds with a list of objects containing icon 
					& children with an optional search property 
					(defaults to "in:"key). Icon is a URL, and 
					children is an Array of the same objects. 
 robot.fetchwavelet(waveID : String,	Responds with data in identified wave in 
   waveletId:String, message:String)	properties wavelet of type WaveletData and 
					blips Array of BlipData.
 robot.search(query : String, 		Interprets query as described later, and 
   index:Integer, numResults:Integer)	responds with an Array of results in range of 
					index and numResults with properties title, 
					snippet, waveId, lastModified, unreadCount, 
					blipCount, and participants.
 robot.folderAction(modifyHow : String,	Performs selected action of actions (markAsRead,
   waveId : String)			markAsUnread, mute, and archive <default>) on 
					identified wave.
 robot.getUserData(user : String)          Returns the avatar, note, and name of user as Strings.

 wavelet.appendBlip(waveId : String,	Appends blipData to selected wavelet of selected 
  waveletId:String, blipData:BlipData)	wave.
 wavelet.setTitle(waveId : String,	Sets the title of selected wavelet of selected 
   waveletId : String, 			wave.
   waveletTitle : String)
 wavelet.addParticipant(waveId:String,	Adds selected participant to selected wavelet 
   waveletId : String, 			of selected wave.
   participant : String)
 wavelet.setDataDoc(waveId : String,	Sets selected dataDocument of selected wavelet 
   waveletId : String, 			of selected wave to dataDocValue.
   dataDocName : String, 
   dataDocValue : Object)

 blip.createChild(waveId : String,	Appends blipData to the identified blip of the 
   waveletId:String, blipdid:String,	identified wavelet of the identified wave.
   blipData : BlipData)
 blip.delete(waveId : String, 		Deletes the identified blip of the identified 
   waveletId: String, blipdid: String)	wavelet of the identified wave.

 document.appendMarkup(waveId : String,	Appends content translated from HTML to Wave to 
   waveletId: String, blipdid: String,	identified blip to identified wavelet of 
   content : String)			identified wave.
 document.modify(waveId : String,	Replaces content selected by either range or 
   waveletId : String, blipId : String,	index with modifyAction inside the identified
   range : Range, index : Integer, 	blip of the identified wavelet of the identified
   modifyAction : ModifyAction)		wave.

Types
---
 Type		Properties		Description
 ----		----------		-----------
 WaveletData	participants		Array of the wave addresses of the participants
					on the wave.
		rootBlipId		The ID of the root blip as a String.
 		title			The title of the wave as a String.
 		waveId			The waveId of the wave as a String.
 		waveletId		The waveletId of the root wavelet.
 		dataDocuments		Object associating document IDs to objects of
					their data.
 BlipData	blipId			contains the ID of blip in which the event 
					occurred.
 		childBlipIds		contains an array of blip IDs for each of the 
					blip's children.
 		content			contains the textual content of this blip.
 		waveId			contains the Wave ID associated with this blip.
 		waveletId		contains the wavelet ID associated with this 
					blip. 

 		(optional:)
 		annotations		array of annotations associated with the blip. 						The annotation is represented by an object with 
					range (containing start and end properties), 	
					key, and value.
 		elements		contains gadgets, controls, and attachments 
					associated with the blip.
 Range		start			Integer of the start index.
		end			Integer of the end index.
 ModifyAction	content			String representing content.
		annotations		key:value object representing the annotations 
					applied.
		elements		contains gadgets, controls, and attachments to 
					add to the blip.
 Element	type			"gadget", "control", or "attachment"
		index			Integer index in it's blip.
		(further identified by type, as in gadget has url & state, controls has 
		name & value, and attachments has url & caption)

Query Syntax
---
Search should be interpreted as a list of words to search either wave bodies and tags or wave addresses. Quotes can be used to identify phrases. In addition, users can use the operators defined in the following table for more specific searches by prefixing the phrase/word with the operator and a colon (:). Partial or inexact matches aren't a neccessary feature.
 Operator	Description
 --------	-----------
 creator	All waves created by search
 from		All waves created by search
 participant	All waves where search is a direct participant (may be a robot)
 with		All waves where search is a direct participant (may be a robot)
 contributor	All waves where search eddited at least one blip
 by		All waves where search eddited at least one blip
 to		All waves where search is a participant but not the creator.
 onlyto		All waves where search is the only participant besides the creator.
 onlyby		All waves where search is the only contributor.
 onlywith	All waves where search is the only participant.
 dfrom		All waves by search directly to you.
 dto		All waves to search directly from you.

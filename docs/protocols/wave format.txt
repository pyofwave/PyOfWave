Wave Format
-----------
Job: To describe the concepts and standards used between the other wave standards.
Existing Standards: CSS (illustrative)

Overview:
---
This document describes the programmatic structure of a "wave", which is a single message/conversation in Wave. 

Terms:
---
Wave: A single conversation/message. Refers to a creator and root wavelet, as well as it's history. Identified by an ID.
Wavelet: A collection of blips which limited people may read and write to. Identified by an ID.
Blip: A message in a wave, like a comment on a forum. Identified by an ID.
User: A waver, or some one who uses wave. Identified by a wave address.
Annotation: Applies style to a section of text.
Gadget: A JavaScript embedded inside a cell in a blip which performs a handy task via shared state (e.g. gets the conscensious on a topic, maps out a plan).
Attachments: A file embedded inside a wave.
Controls: A "widget" embedded inside a blip.

Annotation
---
Many of the standards use a key value map of annotations. These annotations are defined here.

Style
--
These style annotations are the same as their corresponding CSS properties.
-style/backgroundColor
-style/color
-style/fontFamily
-style/fontSize
-style/fontStyle
-style/fontWeight
-style/textDecoration
-style/verticalAlign

User
--
-user/d/<session id>
	This annotation covers the entire document. The value of the 
	annotation is a comma separated list of (userid, timestamp [,ime 
	composition state]) The timestamp is the last time the cursor was 
	updated. The timestamp may be used by clients to stop dislpaying 
	the users carat after a period of inactivity.
-user/r/<session id>
	This annotation represents the users selection. That is, the range 
	of text with this annotation is text that the user has selected. If 
	the user does not have any text selected then this annotation is 
	not present. Note that the currently implementation only supports a 
	single selection region per user. The value of this annotation is 
	the user id.
-user/e/<session id>
	This annotation represents the user's selection focus (the "blinky 
	bit"). The first point in the range of the annotation is the cursor 
	location for the users session. That is, the cursor is placed 
	before the first item in the annotation range. This annotation 
	always extends from the cursor position to the end of the document. 
	If this annotation is missing then the cursor is placed after the 
	last item in the document. The value of this annotation is the user 
	id.

User Wave Addresses are in the form username@provider-domain.com, in any standard where Wave Addresses are used. 
In addition, aliases may be used in any standard for contributors but not participants. These are in the form AliasAccount/RealAccount. Aliases should have tight security, and are provided for use by "groups" (equivalant to mailing lists).

Links
--
-link/manual
	A manually created link. A URI or IRI? is the only valid value for 
	this annotation.
-link/auto
	A link created automatically by some linkifying process. Such 
	annotations have a lower precedence than manual links. A URI is the 
	only valid value for this annotation.
-link/alias
	The account to use to access the linked wave(s) if you are not a 
	participant. Your address will still be visible, and clients may 
	only use their own address for this value.
